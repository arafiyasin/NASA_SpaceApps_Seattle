        **4. Conclusion**

**Conclusion (1): Investigating Period Variations**
Our study of CP Lac, a poorly studied nova remnant, revealed a period of 3.2 hours through a 4-day observation at the Manastash Ridge Observatory. This closely aligns with the AAVSO catalogue value, strengthening the reliability of our results. Our focus on potential period variations enhances our understanding of this cataclysmic variable.

**Conclusion (2): Contextualizing Results and Future Directions**
Our analysis uncovered a 13-minute and 44-second shift in the period, prompting consideration of factors like data averaging and an accelerated rotation. This discrepancy opens avenues for future investigation. Comparisons with P. Rodriguez-Gill et al.'s comprehensive work and Strope et al.'s unique findings emphasize CP Lac's intricate behavior. While data limitations exist, our study forms a foundation for future research. The convergence of our period determination with historical records and unique lightcurve patterns provides impetus for further exploration. This study underscores the potential for future observations to elucidate the dynamics and evolution of CP Lac, contributing to the broader understanding of cataclysmic variables in the universe.
